# water_reminder_bot


 Features
Per-user loops – only the person who started a reminder gets pinged.
Channel aware – pick #any-channel, or let the current one be used.
Friendly slash-style text commands (!hydrate 30, !stretch 15, !stop).
Random images/gifs (place files in memes/ and stretch/).
Robust cancellation – !stop halts loops immediately (no “one last ping”).
Single-embed !help with inline examples.
Clear error handling, logging, and dotenv-based secrets.
